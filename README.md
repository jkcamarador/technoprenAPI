### Predict a disease based on the given symptoms and present the disease description and precautions.

Found a dataset of symptoms labeled with a disease. Performed data cleaning and engineering before feeding the data into a Random Forest Classifier model. I created an API using Flask to deploy the model. 

Using the test data, the Random Forest Classifier model got an accuracy of 100%, a confusion matrix was also utilized, and no misclassified disease was predicted on the test data set.
